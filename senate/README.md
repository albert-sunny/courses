# Proposals to the Senate

This directory contains the proposals to the senate regarding the
curriculum. The convention is that we have a file called `working.org`
that collects the pending issues which will be proposed in the next
senate. Once the senate is convened, we will present the proposal and
document the feed back. Items handled will be marked with a DONE.

The working.org file becomes the `YYYY-MM-DD.org` file where the
`YYYY-MM-DD` denotes the date of the senate meeting when the items
were presented.
