# Syllabus 

*Basic organization of a computer:* ALU, input-output units, memory, program counter - variables and
addresses - instructions: store, arithmetic, input and output

*Simple sequential programs*
*Memory state transitions*
*Conditional instruction:* if then else, control flow diagrams, nested conditions
*Iterations:* while loop and its control flow
*Arrays:* indexing, memory model, programs with array of integers, two dimensional arrays
*Variants of conditional and iterative instructions*

*Pointers:* dereferencing and address operators, pointer and address arithmetic, array manipulation using pointers

*Functions:* modularity, declaration and definition, function call and return and associated control flow, functions
with parameters, returning a value, multiple parameters, data flow during function call, modifying
parameters inside functions using pointers, arrays as parameters. 

*Computer representation of integers:* signed and unsigned integers, ranges and overflow 
*Different data types:*  floating point representations, precision and range, error in representation

*Functions with different parameter types and return types *,user defined data types for data abstraction.

Recommended programming language to be used for instruction is C.
