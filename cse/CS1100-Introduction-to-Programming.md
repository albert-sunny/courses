# Learning Objectives

No prior programming experience is assumed. The main objective is to
develop the skill to solve simple computational problems by designing
step by step logical solutions and converting them to computer
programs. Standard programming constructs like conditional execution,
iteration, arrays and functions will be introduced. Basics of
organization of a computing unit and computer representation of
numbers will also be covered. Towards the last part of the course
students will be introduced to data abstraction. This course will
provide students with sufficient coding skills for any course with a
programming component like Programming and Data Structures,
Computational methods and CAD Laboratory.

# Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to design and code
simple moderate sized (100 to 200 lines) programs for solving simple
computational tasks. Students will also be able to understand and
debug moderate sized programs written by others. Through the lab
exercises, students will be able to write modular and maintainable
programs, following one of the standard coding conventions.

# Brief Syllabus

*Basic organization of a computer:* ALU, input-output units, memory,
program counter - variables and addresses - instructions: store,
arithmetic, input and output

*Simple sequential programs*,
*Memory state transitions*,
*Conditional instruction:* if then else, control flow diagrams, nested conditions,
*Iterations:* while loop and its control flow,
*Arrays:* indexing, memory model, programs with array of integers, two dimensional arrays,
*Variants of conditional and iterative instructions*

*Pointers:* dereferencing and address operators, pointer and address arithmetic, array manipulation using pointers

*Functions:* modularity, declaration and definition, function call and
return and associated control flow, functions with parameters,
returning a value, multiple parameters, data flow during function
call, modifying parameters inside functions using pointers, arrays as
parameters.

*Computer representation of integers:* signed and unsigned integers,
*ranges and overflow, Different data types:* floating point
*representations, precision and range, error in representation

*Functions with different parameter types and return types*, *user
 defined data types for data abstraction*.

Recommended programming language to be used for instruction is C.
