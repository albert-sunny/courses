# Learning Objectives

This course concentrates on recognizing and solving modern data science problem that arise in applications. 

# Learning outcome

At the end of course student will be able to implement and use few existing modern technique for big data in their projects. Student will be able to analysis the complexity of an optimization problem and its solution.
